# Mountain Climber Workspace Configuration Example
# This file shows the structure of a single workspace configuration
# Each workspace has its own file in ~/.climber-config/workspaces/

# Root directory containing all your projects for this workspace
root: /Users/developer/my-services

# List of all available projects in this workspace
projects:
  - name: database
    path: database
    description: PostgreSQL database service
  - name: redis
    path: cache/redis
    description: Redis cache service
  - name: api
    path: backend/api
    description: REST API service
  - name: worker
    path: backend/worker

# Environment configurations for this workspace
environments:
  default:
    description: Default environment with all services
    projects: [database, redis, api, worker, frontend, monitoring]

  development:
    description: Development environment with core services only
    projects: [database, redis, api, frontend]

  staging:
    description: Staging environment for testing
    projects: [database, redis, api, worker, frontend]

  production:
    description: Production environment with all services
    projects: [database, redis, api, worker, frontend, monitoring]

# Service dependencies (determines startup order)
dependencies:
  # API depends on database and redis
  api: [database, redis]

  # Worker depends on database, redis, and api
  worker: [database, redis, api]

  # Frontend depends on API
  frontend: [api]

  # Monitoring depends on API (to scrape metrics)
  monitoring: [api]

# Usage examples for this workspace:
#
# Start all services in default environment:
#   climb up
#
# Start only development services:
#   CLIMBER_ENV=development climb up
#
# Start production environment:
#   CLIMBER_ENV=production climb up
#
# The startup order will be:
#   1. database, redis (no dependencies)
#   2. api (depends on database, redis)
#   3. worker (depends on database, redis, api)
#   4. frontend (depends on api)
#   5. monitoring (depends on api)
#
# Workspace management:
#   climb workspace list                    # List all workspaces
#   climb workspace create my-project       # Create new workspace
#   climb workspace switch my-project       # Switch to workspace
#   CLIMBER_WORKSPACE=my-project climb up   # Use workspace for single command
