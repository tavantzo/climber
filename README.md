## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g mountain-climber
```

or

```bash
yarn global add mountain-climber
```

### Quick Start

**1. Create a workspace (recommended):**
```bash
climb workspace create my-project "My awesome project"
```

**2. Initialize your configuration:**
```bash
climb init
```

The initialization wizard will guide you through setting up your configuration with **interactive tab completion** and **filesystem support**:

1. **Root Directory**: Enter the root directory containing your projects
   - **Tab completion** for directory navigation
   - **`~` support** for home directory shortcuts
   - **Relative path** support with `../` navigation
2. **Project Discovery**: Choose between auto-discovery or manual project entry
3. **Project Details**: For each project, specify:
   - Project name
   - Relative path from root directory
   - Description (optional)
4. **Environments**: Configure different environments (development, staging, production)
5. **Dependencies**: Set up service dependencies and startup order

**Example Configuration:**
```yaml
root: /Users/developer/my-services
projects:
  - name: database
    path: database
    description: PostgreSQL database service
  - name: api
    path: backend/api
    description: REST API service
  - name: frontend
    path: frontend
    description: React frontend application
environments:
  default:
    description: Default environment
    projects: [database, api, frontend]
  development:
    description: Development environment
    projects: [database, api]
  production:
    description: Production environment
    projects: [database, api, frontend]
dependencies:
  api: [database]
  frontend: [api]
```

**Auto-discovery mode** automatically finds docker-compose files under the declared root directory. Just follow the wizard!

**3. Start your services:**
```bash
# Start all services (shows interactive selection menu)
climb up

# Or start specific projects directly
climb up database api
```

Now the tool is ready to use! üöÄ

## Project Selection

Mountain Climber supports selecting specific projects for all core commands, giving you fine-grained control over which services to manage.

### Command Line Selection

Specify project names as arguments to target specific projects:

```bash
# Start only specific projects
climb up insights sentinel

# Stop only specific projects  
climb down insights

# Get logs from specific projects
climb logs insights sentinel

# Follow logs from specific projects
climb logs -f sentinel
```

### Interactive Selection

When no projects are specified, Mountain Climber shows an interactive checkbox menu:

```bash
# Shows interactive menu to select projects
climb up
climb down  
climb logs
```

**Interactive Menu Example:**
```
? Select projects to start: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
‚ùØ‚óâ insights - Analytics and monitoring service
 ‚óâ sentinel - Security monitoring service  
 ‚óâ api-gateway - Main API gateway
 ‚óâ database - PostgreSQL database
```

### Project Selection Benefits

- **Faster Development**: Work on specific services without managing all projects
- **Resource Efficiency**: Only start the services you need
- **Focused Debugging**: Get logs from specific projects only
- **Flexible Workflows**: Mix command-line and interactive selection as needed

climb workspace current                 # Show current workspace
climb workspace info my-project         # Show workspace details
CLIMBER_WORKSPACE=my-project climb up   # Use workspace for single command
```

## Configuration

### Workspace Management

Mountain Climber supports multiple workspaces to organize different projects:

```bash
# Create a new workspace
climb workspace create my-project "My awesome project"

# List all workspaces
climb workspace list

# Switch to a workspace
climb workspace switch my-project

# Use a workspace for a single command
CLIMBER_WORKSPACE=my-project climb up
```

**Workspace Structure:**
```
~/.climber-config/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workspaces.yaml          # Workspace registry
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workspaces/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default.yaml         # Default workspace config
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-project.yaml      # My project workspace config
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ another-project.yaml # Another project workspace config
```

Each workspace has its own:
- Root directory
- Project list
- Environment configurations
- Service dependencies

### Environment Management

Mountain Climber supports multiple environments to manage different sets of services:

```bash
# Use default environment
climb up

# Use specific environment
CLIMBER_ENV=development climb up
CLIMBER_ENV=staging climb up
CLIMBER_ENV=production climb up
```

### Service Dependencies

Configure service dependencies to ensure proper startup order:

```yaml
dependencies:
  api: [database]        # API depends on database
  frontend: [api]        # Frontend depends on API
  worker: [database, api] # Worker depends on both database and API
```

Services will start in dependency order (database ‚Üí api ‚Üí frontend ‚Üí worker) and stop in reverse order.

### Configuration File

The configuration is stored in `~/.climber-config/config.yaml` and supports:

- **YAML format** for better readability
- **Environment-specific** project lists
- **Service dependencies** with automatic topological sorting
- **Project descriptions** for better organization
- **Automatic migration** from old JSON format

### Configuration Examples

**Development Environment:**
```yaml
environments:
  development:
    description: Development environment
    projects: [database, api]  # Only core services
```

**Production Environment:**
```yaml
environments:
  production:
    description: Production environment
    projects: [database, api, frontend, monitoring]  # All services
```
